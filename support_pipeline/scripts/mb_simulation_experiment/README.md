# Description

This folder contains scripts for evaluating the coverage performance of MrBayes on increasingly reaslistic simulations.

## Approach
...


# Instructions

1. Run `run_simulations_cluster.sh` to generate simulated data that is increasingly realistic (varies in substitituion model, site invaraince, rate variation, amount of hypermutation).

2. Run historydag and mrbayes inference
